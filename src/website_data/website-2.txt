I
want
to
eliminate
all
the
whitespace
from
a
string,
on
both
ends,
and
in
between
words.
I
have
this
Python
code:
def
my_handle(self):
sentence
=
'
hello
apple
'
sentence.strip()
But
that
only
eliminates
the
whitespace
on
both
sides
of
the
string.
How
do
I
remove
all
whitespace?

@JoachimPileborg,
not
exactly
I
think,
because
it's
also
about
reducung

the

Correct
me
if
wrong,
but
"whitespace"
is
not
synonymous
with
"space
characters".
The
current
answer
marked
as
correct
does
not
remove
all
whitespace.
But,
since
it's
marked
as
correct
it
must
have
answered
the
intended
question?
So
we
should
edit
the
question
to
reflect
the
accepted
answer?
@Kalanamith
Did,
or
do,
you
want
to
remove
all
whitespace
or
only
spaces?

If
you
want
to
remove
leading
and
ending
spaces,
use
str.strip():
sentence
=
'
hello
apple'
sentence.strip()
>>>
'hello
apple'
If
you
want
to
remove
all
spaces,
use
str.replace():
sentence
=
'
hello
apple'
sentence.replace("
",
"")
>>>
'helloapple'
If
you
want
to
remove
duplicated
spaces,
use
str.split():
sentence
=
'
hello
apple'
"
".join(sentence.split())
>>>
'hello

that
it

I
like
"".join(sentence.split()),
this
removes
all
whitespace
(spaces,
tabs,
newlines)
from
anywhere

@YannisDran
check
the
str.join()
documentation,
when
you
call
sentence.join(str_list)
you
ask
python
to
join
items
from
str_list
with
sentenceas
separator.

To
remove
only
spaces
use
str.replace:
sentence
=
sentence.replace('
',
'')
To
remove
all
whitespace
characters
(space,
tab,
newline,
and
so
on)
you
can
use
split
then
join:
sentence
=
''.join(sentence.split())
or
a
regular
expression:
import
re
pattern
=
re.compile(r'\s+')
sentence
=
re.sub(pattern,
'',
sentence)
If
you
want
to
only
remove
whitespace
from
the
beginning
and
end
you
can
use
strip:
sentence
=
sentence.strip()
You
can
also
use
lstrip
to
remove
whitespace
only
from
the
beginning
of
the
string,
and
rstrip
to
remove
whitespace
from
the
end
of
the
string.

re.sub

If
you
also
want
to
remove
all
the
other
strange
whitespace
characters
that
exist
in
unicode
you
can
use
re.sub
with
the
re.UNICODE
arguement:
sentence
=
re.sub(r"\s+",
"",
sentence,
flags=re.UNICODE)
...
because
do
you
really
want
to
keep
these
strange
unicode
characters?

@Sarang:
Those

characters
(google
them
and
you'll

but
"General

My

removing

classified
as
whitespace.

Whitespace
includes
space,
tabs
and
CRLF.
So
an
elegant
and
one-liner
string
function
we
can
use
is
translate.(Surprised
no
one
mentioned
it!)
'
hello
apple'.translate(None,
'
\n\t\r')
OR
if
you
want
to
be
thorough
import
string
'
hello
apple'.translate(None,
string.whitespace)

ans.translate(
None,

)
produces
only
builtins.TypeError:
translate()
takes
exactly
one
argument
(2
given)
for
me.
Docs
says
that
argument
is
a

table,

And

Be
careful:
strip
does
a
rstrip
and
lstrip
(removes
leading
and
trailing
spaces,
tabs,
returns
and
form
feeds
but
does
not
remove
them
in
the
middle
of
the
string)
if
you
only
replace
spaces
and
tabs
you
can
end
up
with
hidden
CRLF
that
appear
to
match
what
you
are
looking
for
but
are
not
the
same
